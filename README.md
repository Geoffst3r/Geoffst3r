#### Happy to see you here! 
I am a fullstack engineer. I love programming, problem-solving, gaming and traveling.
As a software engineer, I obsess over solving the issues that come my way and enjoy focusing on the issues that can be solved through programming. For these reasons, I focus on making a difference with my programming.
